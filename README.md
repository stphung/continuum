## üéÆ **Game Features**

### **Dual Weapon System**
Switch between two distinct weapon types, each with 5 upgrade levels:
- **Vulcan Cannon**: Rapid-fire spread shots that increase from 1 to 5 projectiles
- **Laser System**: Piercing beams that penetrate multiple enemies with scaling damage

### **Wave-Based Gameplay**
Face increasingly challenging waves of enemies with:
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Enemy health, speed, and point values scale with each wave
- **Formation Patterns**: Enemies spawn in line formations, V-shapes, and random bursts
- **Movement Behaviors**: Straight-line attacks, zigzag patterns, and dive-bomb maneuvers

### **Power-Up System**
Collect floating power-ups that provide:
- **Weapon Upgrades**: Increase your weapon level for more firepower
- **Weapon Switch**: Toggle between Vulcan and Laser systems
- **Bombs**: Screen-clearing explosions for emergency situations
- **Extra Lives**: Extend your survival in the increasingly difficult waves

### **Unique Audio**
Experience a completely procedural soundscape:
- **Zero Audio Files**: All sound effects are generated in real-time using mathematical waveforms
- **Dynamic Audio**: Sounds vary based on context with pitch and frequency modulation
- **Rich Sound Design**: From laser blasts to explosion effects, everything is synthesized on-the-fly

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### **System Requirements**
- Godot Engine 4.4.1 or newer
- SCons build system (`pip install scons`)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

### **Installation & Play**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd continuum

# Install dependencies (one-time setup)
./plug.gd install

# Launch the game
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path .

# Or use the professional build system
scons help  # Show all available commands
```

### **Controls**
```
Movement: Arrow Keys or WASD
Shooting: Spacebar (automatic firing)
Bomb:     Z key (limited use)
Pause:    Escape key
```

## üéØ **How to Play**

1. **Survive the Waves**: Destroy incoming enemies before they overwhelm you
2. **Collect Power-Ups**: Grab floating items to upgrade your weapons and capabilities
3. **Master Both Weapons**: Learn when to use spread fire vs. piercing lasers
4. **Use Bombs Wisely**: Save screen-clearing bombs for critical moments
5. **Achieve High Scores**: Earn points by destroying enemies, with higher waves worth more

### **Weapon Strategy**
- **Vulcan (Spread Fire)**: Excellent for crowd control and multiple weak enemies
- **Laser (Piercing Beam)**: Perfect for tough enemies and tight formations
- **Weapon Levels**: Higher levels increase damage, fire rate, and special effects

### **Survival Tips**
- Stay mobile - movement is key to avoiding enemy fire
- Prioritize power-ups to stay competitive with wave difficulty
- Learn enemy movement patterns to predict and avoid attacks
- Use the invulnerability period after getting hit to reposition safely
